# morseDecoder
Decode morse code from an input switch

Created from an Morse Code program by jcfandino which was found on Google Code at https://code.google.com/archive/p/morse-to-text/source/default/commits

The intent is to use a single input switch to perform multiple functions, by using Morse code:
- to display the time, enter dah (T)
- to display the weather, enter dit dah dah (W)

Two files are included:
- morse-to-text.py  (the functional code)
- codes.csv (conversion table between characters and dots and dashes)
